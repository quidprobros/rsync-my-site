 1. base level exclusion and protection lists
 2. default should be NOT to delete non-matching
 3. protect "home" is relative to remote root: 'P /src' => /a/b/c/src
 4. need to indicate if array config properties are missing, or allow for null lists
 5 deletions only apply to stuff "under" files-from directories on remote

 important rsync notes on --files-from
 -files-from=FILE
     Using this option allows you to specify the exact list of files to transfer (as read from the specified FILE or - for standard input). It also tweaks the default behavior of rsync to make transferring just the specified files and directories easier: 
 o
     The --relative (-R) option is implied, which preserves the path information that is specified for each item in the file (use --no-relative or --no-R if you want to turn that off). 
 o
     The --dirs (-d) option is implied, which will create directories specified in the list on the destination rather than noisily skipping them (use --no-dirs or --no-d if you want to turn that off). 
 o
     The --archive (-a) option's behavior does not imply --recursive (-r), so specify it explicitly, if you want it. 
 o
     These side-effects change the default state of rsync, so the position of the --files-from option on the command-line has no bearing on how other options are parsed (e.g. -a works the same before or after --files-from, as does --no-R and all other options). 
 The filenames that are read from the FILE are all relative to the
     source dir -- any leading slashes are removed and no lq..rq references are allowed to go higher than the source dir. For example, take this command: 
 CW rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr remote:/backup
 If /tmp/foo contains the string lqbinrq (or even lq/binrq), the /usr/bin
     directory will be created as /backup/bin on the remote host. If it contains lqbin/rq (note the trailing slash), the immediate contents of the directory would also be sent (without needing to be explicitly mentioned in the file -- this began in version 2.6.4). In both cases, if the -r option was enabled, that dir's entire hierarchy would also be transferred (keep in mind that -r needs to be specified explicitly with --files-from, since it is not implied by -a). Also note that the effect of the (enabled by default) --relative option is to duplicate only the path info that is read from the file -- it does not force the duplication of the source-spec path (/usr in this case). 
 In addition, the --files-from file can be read from the remote host
     instead of the local host if you specify a lqhost:rq in front of the file (the host must match one end of the transfer). As a short-cut, you can specify just a prefix of lq:rq to mean lquse the remote end of the transferrq. For example: 
 CW rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ /tmp/copy
 This would copy all the files specified in the /path/file-list file that
     was located on the remote lqsrcrq host.
